  <h1>My long term goals</h1>

    Goals can be hard to think about sometimes. However, I know what I want to
    achieve.

      One work place goal is diversity! In the tech industry, it is clear that
      there are some diversity issues. Tech lacks difference. Tech only has 15%
      of its workforce coming from a BAME background. Only 19% of workers are
      women. Even so, 42% of women in tech state that there are a lack of role
      models for them. So how can one woman make a difference without just
      becoming another stat? I think it would be important for the companies in
      tech to be open to employee ideas. Companies should look into programmes
      that promote diversity in the tech sector. For example, a company called
      <a href="https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank"
        >Code First Girls</a
      >
      specialises in promoting and teaching coding to girls and women. Other
      companies such as

        target="_blank"
        >Heroworx</a
      >
      offer bootcamps to help people learn - free of charge! For more
      information on diversity, and to see where I got my stats from, please
